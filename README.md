this is the link to the tutorial i followed on 
how to make this code. The code belongs to these clever people.
The changes in the code ive implimented are in firebase coding 
since the firebase version seemed to have been updated to new 
ways of implimenting code. Thank you

NOTES PLS READ:
the link "https://again-d5564.web.app" is the firebase deployed link.
But i have not made my firebase account in blaze/spark mode
therefore the payment and order page wont work as it should since
there isnt a back-end connection (emulator running)

if you decide to look at this code,
this is the guide for running this code 
and starting the back-end emulator 
so you can look at the orders and payment 
page work

xD thank you for this time
