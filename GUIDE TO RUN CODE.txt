this is the link to the tutorial i followed on 
how to make this code. The code belongs to these clever people.
The changes in the code ive implimented are in firebase coding 
since the firebase version seemed to have been updated to new 
ways of implimenting code. Thank you

NOTES PLS READ:
the link "https://again-d5564.web.app" is the firebase deployed link.
But i have not made my firebase account in blaze/spark mode
therefore the payment and order page wont work as it should since
there isnt a back-end connection (emulator running)

if you decide to look at this code,
this is the guide for running this code 
and starting the back-end emulator 
so you can look at the orders and payment 
page work

xD thank you for this time



//----------RUN THIS APP------------------//

ctrl j
{
    open terminal using 
}

cd amazon-clone
{
    you need to rename your folder from "amazon-clone-with-firebase" 
    to "amazon-clone" to run this
    
    Running this code makes sure youre in file directory 'amazon-clone' 
    and it contains all the files to run the app
}

npm i
{
    github doesnt take folders like node_modules 
    but these can easily be downladed when you 

    wait for a while until finished
}


npm start
{
    in the terminal, run this code 
    this will open a browser page called 'localhost:3000' (React App)
    
    you can see the app running in the browser. Have a look
    BUT ITS NOT FULLY WORKING so go to NEXT STEP
}

//---------------NEXT STEP-------------//

node [+]
{
    YOU DONT RUN THIS (its okay if you did, it didnt harm any files 
    and nothing horrible happened)
    
    open a new node on the right hand side of the terminal
    wait for a bit
}

cd amazon-clone
{
    make sure youre in file directory 'amazon-clone'
}

cd functions
{
    make sure youre in file directory 'functions'
}

npm i
{
    This will download missing files needed to run app
    wait for a while until finished
}

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
{
    run this code to bypass security errors for running firebase
    THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO FIREBASE STUFF 
    (if you make a mistake, dont forget to always run this)
}

firebase emulators:start
{
    run this code and you should get a link to the 
    back end system. 
    
    When its finished, SCROLL UP a bit and you'll 
    see a table with one working link
    
    Click on (Vew in Emulator UI) "http://localhost:4000/functions" 
    OR it might be "http://localhost:4002/functions" 
    if something else is occupying localhost:4000.
    
    and you should see "watching..." and "functions initialize"
    these are the back-end history running. Have a look at 
    this page or the terminal when you 'buy' something in the app
}

------------END OF RUNNING APP---------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some stuff not important: 

ctrl c 
{
      run this in any of the terminals to stop the 
      (localhost:3000)front-end or (localhost:4000)back-end
      
      otherwise you might ended up running on another port if occupied
      (ie. localhost:3002 or localhost:4002) 
      
      it wont affect your experience tho
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------INTERACTING WITH APP --------------------

go back to the 'React App' port (localhost:3000) with the amazon clone running
you can begin interacting with the app on your own !!!
